Running on main function in Recipe class will generate a Recipe and create an XML file for it - plan to generate multiple Recipes in one XML file and use it as in the search function. Search function will search by name + ingredients. Needs to be moved around.

Adding a recipe will require:

2. Updating a XML file of all the Recipes
3. Being able to print it out

Also need to sort out registration + login - use a txt file to store credentials. temp prototype.
